# Netflix-ML-Project
A data science project using Python to analyze Netflix's content library, identifying trends in global production, content growth over time, and genre popularity.
# Netflix Content Analysis Project 🍿

## Project Overview
This project is a deep dive into the Netflix dataset. I used Python to clean the data and create visualizations that show how Netflix has evolved over the years. The goal was to find patterns in the types of content Netflix adds to its platform.

## Key Questions Answered
- **Content Distribution:** Does Netflix have more Movies or TV Shows?
- **Global Reach:** Which countries are the top content producers?
- **Growth Trends:** How has the amount of content changed from 2008 to 2021?
- **Ratings:** What is the most common target audience (Rating) for Netflix content?

## Tools Used
- **Pandas:** For data cleaning and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating professional charts and graphs.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For documenting the step-by-step analysis.



## Data Analysis Highlights
1. **The Movie vs TV Show Gap:** I found that Movies make up the majority of the library, but TV Shows have been growing faster in recent years.
2. **Top Genres:** Analysis shows that "International Movies" and "Dramas" are the most frequent genres.
3. **Release Year Analysis:** A significant spike in content addition occurred after 2015.

## Visualizations Included
- **Bar Charts:** Top 10 Countries by Content.
- **Pie Charts:** Percentage of Movies vs. TV Shows.
- **Line Graphs:** Content added per year.
- **Heatmaps:** To show the correlation between different content features.
